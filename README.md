# Student-Grade-Calculator
The Student Grade Calculator takes marks for five subjects, computes total and average, and assigns grades: A for average ≥ 90, B for ≥ 75, C for ≥ 50, and F for &lt; 50. It helps students quickly assess their academic performance and see which grade they’ve earned based on clear boundaries, providing instant feedback for improvement.
